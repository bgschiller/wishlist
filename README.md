# wishlist

A comparison of framework choices in the spirit of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). **The task**: A gift registry web app.

## Features to include

- register, login, and forgot password flows.
- create a new wishlist with a name
- create, edit, delete items on your wishlist
- make a "shareable link" to your wishlist that doesn't require login
- allow subscribing to changes on a wishlist (via email)
- users should be able to see all their subscriptions, and configure their email frequency: every change, no more than every hour, and no more than once a day.

## Rubric

Stack should be evaluated according to:

- developer experience
- user experience
- ops experience (how difficult is it to deploy?)
- type safety
- ease of testing
